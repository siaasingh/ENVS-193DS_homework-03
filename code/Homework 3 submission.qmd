Problem 1 
a. I could calculate the average number of hours I spent outdoors for each 
day of the week and compare those means. This would help me understand 
how my time outdoors varies by weekdayâ€”perhaps I spend more time outside on 
weekends because I have fewer classes, or less on weekdays with heavy homework 
loads like Monday or Wednesday.

```{r}
# Clean column names to simplify plotting
personal_data <- personal_data |> janitor::clean_names()

# Summarizing mean outdoor hours by weekday
summary_data <- personal_data |> 
  group_by(days_of_the_week) |> 
  summarize(avg_outdoors = mean(hours_spent_outdoors))

# Plot both individual points + summarized means
# Create a plot showing both raw data points and summarized averages:
# - geom_jitter() plots each individual observation, 
#slightly offset to avoid overlap
# - geom_col() overlays bars showing the average hours 
#spent outdoors for each weekday
ggplot(personal_data, aes(x = days_of_the_week, 
                          y = hours_spent_outdoors)) +

This figure shows the average number of hours spent outdoors by day of the week, with

individual data points shown for each entry. The plot highlights that I tend to spend more

time outdoors on weekends like Friday and Saturday, compared to weekdays such as

Monday or Thursday. This may reflect differences in workload and class schedules.

d\. Table Presentation

```{r}
# Load gt package
library(gt)

# Round to 1 decimal and format as a labeled table
summary_data |> 
  mutate(avg_outdoors = round(avg_outdoors, 1)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    days_of_the_week = "Day of the Week",
    avg_outdoors = "Average Hours Spent Outdoors"
  ) |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "Average Outdoor Time by Day of the Week"
  )


```

2a. Since I am not too creative/am bad at drawing, I would want to communicate

more through R. My affective visualization will use bar heights to show time

spent outdoors, but Iâ€™ll emphasize emotion through color, annotation, and storytelling.

For instance, sunnier days will use lighter, warmer tones, while more confined days will

be shaded in cooler blues. I might add emoji annotations to show mood or thoughts from

those days (like ðŸŒ¤). This approach balances structure and feeling â€”

giving a data-rich but deeply personal window into my week. For example, Tuesday

and Wednesday are marked with sunny icons and warm orange bars, while

Monday and Thursday show short bars with sad faces, using cooler tones.

This combination lets me express both the *amount* of time outside and

how it *felt*, adding emotional resonance to the data. Since emojis are not currently

rendering with Rstudio, I had to use descriptive words instead in my example.

library(dplyr)

# Create mood-labeled data
summary_data <- summary_data |> 
  mutate(mood = c("Happy", "Sad", "Happy", "Happy", "Sad", "Neutral", "Sad"))

# Affective bar plot
ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = days_of_the_week, y = avg_outdoors, fill = mood)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.6) +
  geom_text(aes(label = mood), vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Happy" = "#FDAE61",   # warm orange
    "Sad" = "#91BFDB",     # cool blue
    "Neutral" = "#D9D9D9"  # neutral gray
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "My Sunshine Days",
    subtitle = "Each day colored by mood (Happy, Sad, Neutral)",
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Average Hours Outdoors"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )

2d. **Artist Statement**

My piece, *My Sunshine Days*, visualizes the emotional rhythm of my week by

translating hours spent outdoors into colored bars. Each hue evokes a mood

â€”warm oranges for joyful, sunny days, cool blues for quieter, more reflective

moments, and soft greys for those in-between states.I was inspired by affective

visualizations like Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupiâ€™s *Dear Data*, where data

becomes a deeply personal narrative. I aimed to infuse emotional storytelling into

my chartâ€”beyond just numbers.The medium is a ggplot bar chart rendered in R, with

moods represented through intentional color palettes. I initially hoped to enhance

this affective layer using emojis, but due to rendering limitations in Râ€™s

`geom_text()` and even some font display issues in the browser,

the emojis appeared as "tofu boxes." This limitation nudged me to instead lean

into visual color symbolism as my emotional language. The process involved

coding in R with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, structuring the data with mood labels,

then carefully assigning each tone to a color that would evoke the emotion I felt on that day

as I relate being outside with being happy.

3a. **The authors use a combination of statistical techniques to examine**

**how environmental engagement relates to prosocial behavior.**

Specifically, they apply **one-way ANOVA** to test differences in resource allocation

between groups, **chi-squared tests** to assess categorical variable associations,

and **t-tests** for comparing mean scores between high and low environmental

engagement conditions. Additionally, they use **Rasch modeling** to evaluate the

internal consistency and unidimensionality of their behavioral measures. The figure

below illustrates how participants with varying levels of environmental engagement

allocated resources (in points or kW) depending on whether the task was

environmentally relevant, with 95% confidence intervals shown for each condition.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hw2
#| fig-cap: "Figure from Homework 2: Resource allocation by environmental engagement and relevance."
knitr::include_graphics("FigureHW2.png") #code to insert image in the document 




```

3b. The authors clearly represent their statistics in the figure by using bar graphs

with means and 95% confidence intervals, which effectively show the central

tendency and variability. The x- and y-axes are labeled logically, and

categories are clearly differentiated by both environmental relevance and level

of engagement. However, the visualization does not display individual data points,

which limits the reader's ability to assess the distribution or variability within each group.

3c. Aesthetic Clarity - The authors handle visual clarity well by

minimizing clutter and using a clean bar plot with clearly labeled axes and

confidence intervals. The data:ink ratio is effectiveâ€”most of the visual

elements communicate essential information without unnecessary decoration.

While the grayscale color scheme reduces visual noise, it might limit accessibility for readers with contrast sensitivity.

3d. Recommendations

To enhance the interpretability of the figure, I recommend overlaying

individual data points using jittered dot plots to show the distribution and

spread within each conditionâ€”this would reveal heterogeneity that summary

statistics like means and 95% confidence intervals alone may obscure.

Additionally, incorporating exact sample sizes directly beneath each bar would

contextualize the standard errors and allow for better judgment.

The figure could also benefit from improved differentiation between groups (

e.g., through patterned bar fills or higher-contrast color palettes), which

would increase perceptual clarity, especially in grayscale or for color vision deficiencies.

Finally, annotating statistically significant differences (e.g., with asterisks or p-values)

could help convey results more directly without requiring reference to the main text.
